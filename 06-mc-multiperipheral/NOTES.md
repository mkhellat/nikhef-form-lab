# Discussion notes — Part 5 (multiperipheral kinematics)

Running log of questions/derivations as we work through uam19 `part5.pdf`
together. This is the scratch/discussion record; `README.md` will summarize
the settled conclusions once we've covered enough ground.

## Topic 1: "peaks", "types of peaks", and why propagator count grows like $O(2^n)$

### The source sentence

> "...when there are many Feynman diagrams in a reaction, there can be many
> different types of peaks and the number of potential propagators that can
> cause peaking grows like $O(2^n)$, while the number of non-trivial
> integration variables is at most $3n-4$."
> — uam19 `part5.pdf`, p.1

### Parsing it precisely

The sentence makes **two separate claims**, and it's important not to
collapse them into one (an error corrected during this discussion):

1. **Qualitative claim:** "there can be many different **types** of peaks."
   This is about *kinds* of peaks, not a count.
2. **Quantitative claim:** "the number of potential **propagators** that can
   cause peaking grows like $O(2^n)$." The grammatical subject being counted
   is *propagators*; "that can cause peaking" is a restrictive clause
   narrowing which propagators are in view (only ones capable of going
   small/near-singular in the accessible kinematic region) — it is not a
   second, independently-counted quantity.

The two claims are related but distinct: claim 2 (propagator count) explains
*one* source of the "many different types" in claim 1, but not the only one.

### "Peak" vs. "pole"/"singularity" — deliberate, not sloppy

Vermaseren uses "peak" as the general/operative term and "pole" as a
narrower one — he writes "peaks/poles" later in the same paragraph, showing
he has both words available and chooses deliberately:

- A **pole** is a property of the integrand *function* — a point where a
  propagator denominator $q^2 - m^2$ hits exactly zero, making the
  integrand formally infinite.
- A **peak** is the *numerically relevant* property for Monte Carlo: a
  region where the integrand is large and sharply varying. Every pole
  produces a peak (if the accessible phase-space region gets close to it),
  but not every peak comes from a true pole — e.g. a Jacobian factor like
  $1/\sqrt{-\Delta_4}$ (see `orient.c`'s doc comment on the Gram
  determinant) peaks without any propagator going on-shell, and the
  numerator/denominator near-cancellation in `pi0.c` (formula 3.2, the
  $1/(t_1t_2)^2$ term) produces a numerically dangerous region without a
  literal pole there either.

So the "different types of peaks" (claim 1) plausibly include at least:

- **Propagator peaks** — $1/(q_i^2-m_i^2)$ small for some internal line $i$.
  This is what claim 2 counts, and what `mapt.c` (the `dt/t` mapping) and
  `t1`/`t2` in `pickin.c` exist to tame.
- **Phase-space-measure/Jacobian peaks** — e.g. the $1/\sqrt{-\Delta_4}$
  factor `orient.c` calls out, unrelated to any single propagator.
- **Cancellation peaks** — large near-equal terms nearly canceling (the
  $O(s^2 M_\pi^4)$ numerator terms in `pi0.c` that the whole Part 5 lecture
  is fundamentally about). Not a pole anywhere; numerically peak-like
  because relative precision collapses there.

### Deriving the $O(2^n)$ propagator count

**Setup.** For an $n$-particle final state produced from a $2\to n$ process,
there are $n_{ext} = n+2$ external legs (2 incoming + $n$ outgoing).

**Key fact (momentum conservation on any diagram):** the momentum flowing
through *any* internal line, in *any* tree diagram for this process, equals
(up to overall sign) the sum of a subset $S$ of the external momenta — this
follows just from conservation at each vertex, regardless of which specific
diagram/topology you draw. A subset $S$ and its complement $S^c$ (all other
legs) describe the *same* physical line, since $q$ and $-q$ give the same
propagator denominator $q^2-m^2$.

**Counting distinct possible propagator momenta.** The number of subsets of
$n_{ext}$ legs is $2^{n_{ext}}$. Divide by 2 for the $S\leftrightarrow S^c$
symmetry, then exclude the trivial subsets that aren't internal lines at all
(the empty set / full set — that's just overall momentum conservation — and
single-leg subsets / their complements, which are external legs, not
internal propagators). Working this out exactly:

$$\text{distinct propagator momenta} = 2^{n_{ext}-1} - n_{ext} - 1 = 2^{n+1} - n - 3$$

This was verified by brute-force enumeration (see calc below) for
$n=1,\dots,7$ — exact match. Asymptotically this is $\sim 2^{n+1}$, i.e.
$O(2^n)$: Big-O absorbs the factor of 2 and the $-n-3$ correction, which is
exactly the sense in which the lecture's claim is correct — it's an
order-of-growth statement, not an exact formula.

| $n$ (final-state particles) | $n_{ext}=n+2$ | exact distinct propagator momenta | $2^n$ |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 0 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | 5 | 10 | 8 |
| 4 | 6 | 25 | 16 |
| 5 | 7 | 56 | 32 |
| 6 | 8 | 119 | 64 |
| 7 | 9 | 246 | 128 |

**What $n$ is:** the number of final-state particles — confirmed directly
by the very next clause in the same sentence, "the number of non-trivial
integration variables is at most $3n-4$", which is the standard
Byckling–Kajantie phase-space dimension count for an $n$-body final state
(sanity check: $n=2 \Rightarrow 3(2)-4=2$, the two independent angles of a
2-body decay in its rest frame — correct).

### Why this matters: the actual point of the sentence

The number of **potential** peak-causing propagators grows *exponentially*
in $n$ ($O(2^n)$), while your budget of **integration variables** to build
importance-sampling mappings along grows only *linearly* in $n$ ($3n-4$).
That mismatch is the structural reason multiperipheral/many-particle phase
space is hard: you cannot in general build one universal coordinate system
that flattens every potential peak using only $3n-4$ coordinates once the
number of potential peaks outstrips that budget. Hence the very next
sentence in the lecture: split phase space into pieces, each handling only
a *limited* number of peaks/poles, with a dedicated parametrization per
piece.

### Worked example: our own diagram, $n=3$

Final state $p_3,p_4,p_5$ from $p_1,p_2 \to p_3,p_4,p_5$ (5 external legs).
Brute-force enumeration of all non-trivial leg subsets (mod
complementation) gives exactly **10** distinct possible propagator momenta
— matching $2^{n+1}-n-3 = 2^4-3-3=10$. Listed by which legs they group:

```
{p1,p2}  {p1,p3}  {p1,p4}  {p1,p5}
{p1,p2,p3}  {p1,p2,p4}  {p1,p2,p5}
{p1,p3,p4}  {p1,p3,p5}  {p1,p4,p5}
```

(each subset's complement is the same physical line, so only one
representative per pair is listed).

Of these 10 *potential* propagators, the **specific double-t-channel
diagram** this lecture builds kinematics for uses only **2**:

- $q_1 = p_1-p_3$, i.e. subset $\{p_1,p_3\}$ — this is `t1` in `pickin.c`
- $q_2 = p_2-p_5$, i.e. subset $\{p_2,p_5\}$ — this is `t2` in `pickin.c`

The other 8 subsets correspond to propagators that would appear in *other*,
undrawn diagrams for the same $e^-e^+\to p_3p_4p_5$ final state (e.g. an
s-channel-like diagram grouping $\{p_1,p_2\}$). This is the concrete
illustration of the gap between "propagators in one diagram" (small, grows
roughly linearly — $n-1=2$ here for a cubic tree) and "potential
propagators across all diagrams for the process" (the $O(2^n)$ ceiling the
lecture is bounding).

### Reproduction script

```python
from itertools import combinations

def distinct_propagator_momenta(n_ext):
    legs = list(range(n_ext))
    seen = set()
    for size in range(2, n_ext - 1):   # exclude 0,1,n_ext-1,n_ext (trivial)
        for combo in combinations(legs, size):
            s = frozenset(combo)
            comp = frozenset(legs) - s
            canon = min(s, comp, key=lambda x: sorted(x))
            seen.add(canon)
    return len(seen)

for n in range(1, 8):
    n_ext = n + 2
    print(n, n_ext, distinct_propagator_momenta(n_ext), 2**(n_ext-1) - n_ext - 1)
```

### Open threads / not yet resolved

- We have not yet catalogued the *other* "types" of peaks beyond the three
  listed above (propagator / Jacobian / cancellation) — is that an
  exhaustive list, or are there more categories the lecture has in mind
  later on?

## Topic 2: "the number of non-trivial integration variables is at most $3n-4$"

### What "non-trivial integration variable" means

Phase space for an $n$-particle final state is, before any reduction,

$$d\Phi_n = \prod_{i} \frac{d^3p_i}{(2\pi)^3\,2E_i}\;(2\pi)^4\,
\delta^{(4)}\!\Big(P-\sum_i p_i\Big)$$

Each final-state particle contributes 3 real numbers (its 3-momentum —
energy is fixed by the mass-shell condition $E_i=\sqrt{p_i^2+m_i^2}$, so it
is *not* an independent degree of freedom). That gives $3n$ numbers before
any constraint. The $\delta^{(4)}$ removes exactly 4 of them (fixes total
energy and 3-momentum to match the initial state). Nothing else is
subtracted in the formula itself:

$$3n - 4$$

**"Non-trivial" here means: an independent number you actually integrate
(sample) over**, as opposed to (a) a component fixed outright by
conservation, or (b) a genuinely flat/uncorrelated direction that
contributes only an overall constant to the integral (e.g. $2\pi$) without
adding any structure worth stratifying/mapping.

**Check against the familiar 2-body case ($n=2$):** $3n-4=2$. In the CM
frame, once $\sqrt{s}$ is fixed and one particle's momentum is chosen the
other is back-to-back by conservation — the only freedom left is the
direction of one outgoing particle: $(\theta,\phi)$, exactly 2 numbers.
$\theta$ is physical (it sets $t=(p_1-p_3)^2$, a propagator variable).
$\phi$ (azimuth around the beam axis) is "trivial" in the sense above: for
unpolarized beams the physics doesn't depend on it, it integrates to a flat
factor of $2\pi$ — but it is still formally one of the $3n-4$ numbers, not
a *third* subtraction on top of $3n-4$. This matters: **the naive
expectation that you should separately subtract 3 more for "overall
rotational freedom of the final state" is wrong** — only 1 direction
(azimuth about the fixed beam axis) is a symmetry for a fixed-beam
collision; the polar orientation relative to the beam is physical. So
$3n-4$ already has exactly the right amount of "triviality" baked in via
the conservation-law subtraction alone; there is no separate rotational
subtraction to make.

### Checking this against our actual code: `pickin.c`/`orient.c`/`eepi.c` ($n=3$)

$3n-4 = 3(3)-4 = 5$ for our diagram. Every claim below is anchored to
specific lines, re-extracted and read directly from `kinc2.tar.gz`
(`_course_/-0-uam19/kinc2.tar.gz`) on 2026-08-08 — quoted, not paraphrased,
so this can be independently re-checked against the archive.

**Claim: only 4 random numbers are consumed by the $n=3$ pipeline, not 5.**

`eepi.c:14-20` is the entry point VEGAS would call for this reaction:

```c
double eepi(double *rannums)
{
    ...
    dj = orient(eemminput.sq*eemminput.sq,
        eemminput.me,eemminput.me,eemminput.me,eemminput.mu,eemminput.me,
        rannums,0);
```

`orient.c:31` immediately forwards the same `rannums` pointer into `pickin`
unchanged:

```c
if ( ( dj = pickin(s,m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,rannums,options) ) == 0 ) return(0);
```

Inside `pickin.c`, a full-text search for `rannums[` turns up exactly these
four indices and no others (`pickin.c:79,93,126,127,142,167,168,177`):

```c
79:   extra.s2 = mapw(sig1,smax,&ds2,rannums[2],1);
93:   extra.t1 = mapt(t1min,t1max,&dt1,rannums[0],1);
126:  if ( option < -1 ) extra.s2 = mapw(sig2,s2max,&ds2,rannums[2],1);
127:  if ( option == -1 ) extra.s2 = mapla(sig2,s2max,extra.t1,pickzz.w2,&ds2,rannums[2]);
142:  extra.t2 = mapt(t2min,t2max,&dt2,rannums[1],1);
167:  if ( option > 1 ) extra.s2 = mapw(s2min,s2max,&ds2,rannums[2],1);
168:  if ( option == 1 ) extra.s2 = mapla(s2min,s2max,extra.t1,pickzz.w2,&ds2,rannums[2]);
177:  yy4 = cos(pi*rannums[3]);
```

So the indices actually touched are `{0,1,2,3}` — never `rannums[4]`. This
is independently corroborated by `eepi.c`'s own diagnostic/histogram block
(`eepi.c:29-39`), which logs exactly these four back out and nothing more:

```c
if ( withplots ) {
    lplot.xvalue[0] = log10(-extra.t1);
    lplot.xvalue[1] = log10(-extra.t2);
    lplot.xvalue[2] = log10(variab.p3*variab.st3);
    lplot.xvalue[3] = log10(variab.p4*variab.st4);
    lplot.xvalue[4] = log10(variab.p5*variab.st5);
    lplot.xvalue[5] = rannums[0];
    lplot.xvalue[6] = rannums[1];
    lplot.xvalue[7] = rannums[2];
    lplot.xvalue[8] = rannums[3];
}
```

**Caveat on this claim:** neither `kinc.tar.gz` nor `kinc2.tar.gz` ships a
`main`-style driver that calls `vegas(eepi, ..., ndim, ...)` for this
specific reaction (unlike e.g. `kinc/main3.c:70`:
`vegas(feemm,(double)0.00001,2,60000,6,1)`, which shows `feemm` is called
with VEGAS dimension 6 — that pattern would let us read off `ndim`
directly if a `runpi`-equivalent main file existed). So "4 random numbers,
hence VEGAS dimension 4" is an *inference from usage inside `pickin`*, not
a directly observed `vegas(eepi,...)` call. It is a strong inference (a
function can't productively read an index it doesn't touch), but it should
be flagged as such rather than stated as if we'd seen the `vegas()` call
itself — we haven't, for this particular reaction.

**Claim: what the 4 random numbers become, exactly.**

Reading `pickin.c` top to bottom, in call order:

- `rannums[0]` → `pickin.c:93`, `extra.t1 = mapt(t1min,t1max,&dt1,rannums[0],1)` — the first propagator invariant $t_1$.
- `rannums[1]` → `pickin.c:142`, `extra.t2 = mapt(t2min,t2max,&dt2,rannums[1],1)` — the second propagator invariant $t_2$, computed *after* `t1` because `t2min`/`t2max` depend on `extra.t1` (see `d4 = pickzz.w4-extra.t1` at `pickin.c:96`, used in the `t2max`/`t2min` formulas at lines 139-141). This ordering dependency is itself worth remembering: the 4 variables are not sampled independently of each other's *ranges*, only independently as [0,1]-uniform inputs.
- `rannums[2]` → one of three call sites (`pickin.c:79`, `126-127`, or `167-168`, selected by the `option` argument) → `extra.s2`, the invariant mass$^2$ of the $(p_4,p_5)$ or $(p_3,p_4)$ subsystem depending on ordering choice.
- `rannums[3]` → `pickin.c:177`, `yy4 = cos(pi*rannums[3])` → feeds `levi.delta` at `pickin.c:184` (`levi.delta = delb-yy4*st*sqrt(dd)/(2*ap)`) → which fixes `extra.s1` at `pickin.c:185` (`extra.s1 = extra.t2+pickzz.w1+(2*dotp.p12*r3-4*levi.delta)/st`).

So the 4 inputs become the 4 invariants $t_1, t_2, s_2, s_1$ — matching
Appendix A of the Vermaseren paper. `pickin.c`'s own header comment
(`pickin.c:16-17`) names these directly:

```c
The variables used are in principle t1=(p1-p3)^2, t2=(p2-p5)^2,
s2=(p4+p5)^2 and s1=(p3+p4)^2.
```

and the same comment (`pickin.c:17-20`) is what motivates Topic 3 later:
it explicitly says the Jacobian is $1/\sqrt{-\Delta_4(p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4)}$
and that numerical stability improves by using $\Delta_4$ itself as an
integration variable instead of $s_1$ directly — this is the Jacobian-peak
"type of peak" flagged as an open thread under Topic 1.

**Claim: the 5th ($3n-4=5$) variable — overall azimuth about the beam
axis — is computed, not sampled.**

`orient.c:68-69`:

```c
rr  = sqrt(-levi.gram/s)/(variab.p*variac.pp4);
variab.sp3 = rr/variac.pp3;
```

`sp3` (sin φ₃, per the file's own docstring at `orient.c:15`, "sp3 etc:
sim(phi3)") is computed algebraically from `levi.gram`, which in turn was
already fixed at `pickin.c:188` (`levi.gram = (1-yy4)*(1+yy4)*dd/ap`) purely
in terms of the 4 already-sampled invariants — no new random number enters
between `pickin` returning and `sp3` being set. The **only** remaining
freedom at this stage is a sign choice, resolved at `orient.c:74-79`:

```c
a1  = variac.pp3*variab.cp3-variac.pp5*variab.cp5;
if ( fabs(variac.pp4+variac.pp3*variab.cp3+variab.cp5*variac.pp5)
        >= fabs(fabs(a1)-variac.pp4) ) {
    if ( a1 <  0 ) variab.cp5 = -variab.cp5;
    if ( a1 >= 0 ) variab.cp3 = -variab.cp3;
}
```

This is a **deterministic consistency check** (which branch to take is
decided by comparing two already-computed magnitudes), not a random draw —
confirming there is no hidden 5th `rannums[]` consumption disguised here.

**Conclusion, now grounded in the quoted lines above rather than asserted:**
the code fixes the trivial 5th variable (event orientation about the beam
axis) to a convention — implicitly, φ₃ and φ₅ are pinned relative to each
other and to a plane, per the file's own remark that particle 4 determines
the reference plane (matches the lecture's aside about $e_{p_1p_2p_3p_4}$
and choosing p4 to fix the xz-plane) — rather than sampling and later
averaging over it, because doing so would only multiply the total by the
flat factor $2\pi$ for unpolarized beams. This is the concrete mechanism
behind "at most" in "at most $3n-4$": the code uses 4 of the 5 formally
available slots, having recognized the 5th carries no information worth
paying sampling cost for.

### Why "at most" (not "exactly") $3n-4$

The phrase "at most $3n-4$" (not "exactly") now reads as deliberate too:
$3n-4$ is the *ceiling* set by naive dimensional counting of the
phase-space integral, but a specific diagram/parametrization, once you
exploit its own symmetries (as `orient.c` does with the azimuthal angle
here), may need strictly fewer *sampled* variables than that ceiling — the
"missing" ones are accounted for by direct construction/convention rather
than Monte Carlo integration.

### Open threads / not yet resolved

- We have not yet connected this counting argument to the *general*
  $n$ Byckling–Kajantie derivation (i.e., confirming that for any $n$
  exactly one azimuthal direction is always "free" this way, not just for
  $n=3$) — worth checking if we build a $2\to4$ exercise (`eemm.c`) later,
  where `rannums[4]`, `rannums[5]`, `rannums[6]` appear (per `gamgam.c`/
  `epmm.c`) for the *additional* 2-body sub-decay, which does introduce a
  genuine extra azimuthal random draw (`phicm6` in `gamgam.c`) — that one
  is NOT trivial, because the muon pair's decay plane orientation relative
  to the produced-photon-pair *is* physical once photon polarization/spin
  correlations matter. This distinction (which azimuths are trivial vs.
  physical, and why) is worth a dedicated future topic.
